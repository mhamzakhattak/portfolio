## Projects
- **MalCord** - MalCord Stealer is a sophisticated malware tool that utilizes emoji-based triggers for covert command execution. It features command and control (C2), data exfiltration, browser password stealing, session token hijacking, and connected device scanning to expand its attack surface. MalCord can detect USB devices for data exfiltration or payload deployment and employs a unique persistence method to maintain long-term access.
- **ParadoxAI** - ParadoxAI is an app and browser extension currently under development, designed to detect misinformation campaigns and AI-generated content across the internet. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, ParadoxAI will analyze online content for patterns and anomalies, helping users identify and avoid manipulated or artificially generated information.
- [**GPhisher**](https://github.com/mhamzakhattak/Gphisher) - GPhisher is a clone web app designed for conducting Gmail phishing attacks. Currently, work is underway to create phishlets for Gmail Phisher using EvilGinx, which will leverage its reverse proxy capabilities to enable more advanced and evasive phishing techniques, allowing seamless credential harvesting while bypassing security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and CAPTCHA protections.
- [**video2text**](https://github.com/mhamzakhattak/video2text) - Video2Text is a Python-based tool designed to extract text from videos using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It leverages the OpenCV library for video processing and the pytesseract library to perform OCR, enabling efficient text extraction from video frames.
- [**Textor**](https://github.com/mhamzakhattak/Textor) - Textor is a GUI-based application written in Python that allows users to create, modify, and delete text files.
